# Refine Product Specification

Your task is to generate a clear, comprehensive, and user-focused product specification document.

## Guidelines

- **Purpose & Scope**: Clearly describe the product or featureâ€™s purpose, target users, and intended outcomes.
- **Functionality**: Detail key features, user interactions, and workflows from an end-user perspective.
- **Requirements & Constraints**: List functional and non-functional requirements, as well as any constraints (technical, regulatory, etc.).
- **Implementation Tasks**: Summarize high-level tasks required to implement both functional and non-functional requirements. Present these as actionable items for planning and tracking.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Define clear, measurable criteria that determine when the product or feature is considered complete and ready for release.
- **Usage Examples**: Include code snippets only as usage examples relevant to end users; avoid implementation or internal logic.
- **Source Alignment**: Thoroughly review all project documentation (e.g., `README.md`, `PROJECT_UNDERSTANDING.md`) to ensure accuracy and alignment.
- **Fact-Based**: Base the specification strictly on provided context and requirements; avoid assumptions or fabricated details.
- **Structure & Clarity**: Organize the document with clear sections, headings, and bullet points for readability.
- **Input Handling**: If an input or draft spec is provided, read it fully and update it for alignment with project documentation. If no input is provided, create a new specification in the `specs` folder.
- **Quality**: Ensure the document is concise, relevant, and easy to understand for stakeholders.

## Additional Notes

- Do not include implementation details, internal code logic, or developer instructions.
- Focus on what the product does, not how it is built.
- Use consistent terminology and formatting throughout the document.
