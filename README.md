A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for managing Tempo worklogs in JIRA. This server enables AI assistants to interact with Tempo's time tracking system, allowing for worklog retrieval, creation, bulk operations, and management.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Install in VS Code

[![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_tempo--filler-0098FF?style=for-the-badge&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=ffffff)](vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22tempo-filler%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22stdio%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22%40tranzact%2Ftempo-filler-mcp-server%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22TEMPO_BASE_URL%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3Atempo_base_url%7D%22%2C%22TEMPO_PAT%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3Atempo_pat%7D%22%7D%7D)

       "tempo-filler": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["@tranzact/tempo-filler-mcp-server"],
         "env": {
           "TEMPO_BASE_URL": "https://your-jira-instance.com",
           "TEMPO_PAT": "your-personal-access-token"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## üí¨ Real Usage Example

Here's an actual conversation showing how natural and powerful the interaction can be:

---

**üë§ User:**
> fill my october hours with the same project from september

**ü§ñ AI Assistant:**
> I'll help you fill your October hours with the same project from September. Let me first check your September worklogs to understand the pattern, then fill October accordingly.

```json
üîß mcp_tempo-filler-_get_worklogs({
  "startDate": "2025-09-01",
  "endDate": "2025-09-30"
})
```

> Perfect! I can see you worked on **PROJ-1234** (Tempo MCP Server) for 200 hours in September. Now let me get your October work schedule to see which days need to be filled.

```json
üîß mcp_tempo-filler-_get_schedule({
  "startDate": "2025-10-01", 
  "endDate": "2025-10-31"
})
```

> Excellent! I now have all the information needed. Let me fill all 23 working days in October with the Tempo MCP Server project using 8 hours per working day.

```json
üîß mcp_tempo-filler-_bulk_post_worklogs({
  "billable": true,
  "worklogs": [
    {"issueKey": "PROJ-1234", "hours": 8, "date": "2025-10-01", "description": "Tempo MCP Server development"},
    {"issueKey": "PROJ-1234", "hours": 8, "date": "2025-10-02", "description": "Tempo MCP Server development"},
    // ... 21 more entries for all working days
  ]
})
```

> ‚úÖ **October Hours Filled Successfully**
> 
> - **Project**: PROJ-1234 (Tempo MCP Server)
> - **Total Hours**: 184 hours across 23 working days
> - **Hours per Day**: 8 hours (matching your standard work schedule)
> - **Status**: All entries created successfully with no failures
> 
> **Tool Calls Made:**
> - `get_worklogs` - Retrieved September pattern (PROJ-1234, 200h)
> - `get_schedule` - Found 23 working days in October (184h capacity)
> - `bulk_post_worklogs` - Created 23 entries in one operation
> 
> Your October timesheet is now complete and matches the same project pattern you used in September!

---

**üéØ What Happened Here:**
- **3 Tool Calls**: `get_worklogs` ‚Üí `get_schedule` ‚Üí `bulk_post_worklogs`
- **Smart Pattern Recognition**: Automatically identified PROJ-1234 from September data
- **Schedule Awareness**: Only filled working days, skipped weekends automatically  
- **Bulk Operations**: Created 23 worklog entries in a single API call
- **Error-Free Execution**: 100% success rate with proper validation
- **Natural Language**: No need to remember issue keys, dates, or tool syntax

**‚è±Ô∏è Time Saved**: This single natural language request triggered 3 MCP tool calls and replaced hours of manual timesheet entry!

## üõ†Ô∏è How This Was Built

This MCP server was built in just **3 hours** using AI-powered development tools, demonstrating the power of modern AI-assisted coding:

### Development Timeline

1. **Specification Phase**
   - Created the complete technical specification using **GitHub Copilot** with **Claude Sonnet 4**
   - Defined all API endpoints, data structures, and tool interfaces
   - Refined requirements through iterative conversation

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Used **VS Code** with **Claude Code** to one-shot the entire implementation
   - Generated complete TypeScript codebase, tool implementations, and client logic
   - Implemented all core functionality in a single AI-assisted session

3. **Refinement Phase**
   - Switched back to **GitHub Copilot** with **Claude Sonnet 4** after hitting usage limits in **Claude Code**
   - Fixed API payload formatting and authentication issues
   - Debugged and polished the Tempo API integration

### Key Success Factors

- **Clear specification first**: Having a detailed spec enabled effective one-shot implementation
- **AI tool synergy**: Different AI tools excelled at different phases of development
- **Iterative refinement**: Quick feedback loops with AI assistants for debugging

This project showcases how AI-powered development can dramatically accelerate the creation of robust, production-ready tools.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Get Worklogs**: Retrieve worklogs for users with date range and issue filtering
- **Create Worklogs**: Add single worklog entries with automatic issue resolution
- **Bulk Operations**: Create multiple worklog entries efficiently using concurrent processing
- **Delete Worklogs**: Remove existing worklog entries
- **Resource Access**: Browse worklog data and recent issues
- **Prompt Templates**: Generate analysis prompts for worklog data

## üì¶ Installation

## üåé Real-World Usage Examples

Based on successful implementation, here are practical scenarios:

### Daily Time Logging

```bash
# Using VS Code with GitHub Copilot:
User: "Log 8 hours on PROJ-1234 for today"
AI: ‚úÖ Worklog Created Successfully
    Issue: PROJ-1234 - Example Project Task
    Hours: 8h
    Date: 2025-08-01
    Worklog ID: 1211550
    Time Spent: 1d
```

### Schedule-First Bulk Time Filling

```bash
# RECOMMENDED: Check schedule first, then create entries:
User: "Check my October schedule, then fill all working days with 8 hours on PROJ-1234"
AI: ## Work Schedule (2025-10-01 to 2025-10-31)
    **Period Summary:**
    - Working Days: 23
    - Non-Working Days: 8
    - Total Required Hours: 184h

    ‚úÖ Bulk Worklog Creation Started
    Processing 23 worklog entries (working days only)...
    ‚úÖ Successful: 23
    ‚ùå Failed: 0
    üìä Total Hours: 184
```

### Monthly Time Filling (Legacy)

```bash
# Direct bulk operation (may include non-working days):
User: "Fill all weekdays in July with 8 hours on PROJ-1234"
AI: ‚úÖ Bulk Worklog Creation Started
    Processing 23 worklog entries...
    ‚úÖ Successful: 23
    ‚ùå Failed: 0
    üìä Total Hours: 184
```

### Schedule-Aware Planning

```bash
# Smart time planning workflow:
User: "What's my capacity this month and how should I distribute my time?"
AI: ## Work Schedule (2025-10-01 to 2025-10-31)
    - Working Days: 23
    - Total Required Hours: 184h
    - Average Daily Hours: 8h

    **üí° Next Steps - Schedule-Aware Time Logging:**
    - Total capacity is 184h across 23 working days
    - Example: "Fill all working days shown above with 8 hours on PROJ-1234"
```

### Time Tracking Analysis

```bash
# Monthly summary:
User: "Get my July hours"
AI: üìä Total Hours: 184 hours (23 entries)

    Breakdown by issue:
    ‚Ä¢ PROJ-1234: 184.0h (23 entries)

    Daily pattern: 8 hours per weekday
    Completion: 100% (all weekdays filled)
```
