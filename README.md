# Tempo Filler MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for managing Tempo worklogs in JIRA. This server enables AI assistants to interact with Tempo's time tracking system, allowing for worklog retrieval, creation, bulk operations, and management.

## Quick Start

1. **Build the server**:
   ```bash
   npm install && npm run build
   ```

2. **Configure your AI assistant** with:
   ```json
   {
     "servers": {
       "tempo-filler": {
         "type": "stdio",
         "command": "node", 
         "args": ["path/to/TempoFiller/dist/index.js"],
         "env": {
           "TEMPO_BASE_URL": "https://jira.company.com",
           "TEMPO_PAT": "your-personal-access-token"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Test it**: Ask your AI assistant "Get my worklogs for this week"

## Features

- **Get Worklogs**: Retrieve worklogs for users with date range and issue filtering
- **Create Worklogs**: Add single worklog entries with automatic issue resolution
- **Bulk Operations**: Create multiple worklog entries efficiently using concurrent processing
- **Delete Worklogs**: Remove existing worklog entries
- **Resource Access**: Browse worklog data and recent issues
- **Prompt Templates**: Generate analysis prompts for worklog data

## Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Build the server**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Configuration

The server requires environment variables for authentication and configuration:

### Required Environment Variables

- `TEMPO_BASE_URL`: Your JIRA instance URL (e.g., `https://jira.company.com`)
- `TEMPO_PAT`: Personal Access Token for authentication

### Optional Environment Variables

- `TEMPO_DEFAULT_HOURS`: Default hours per workday (default: 8)

### Creating a Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Log into your JIRA instance
2. Go to **Profile** ‚Üí **Personal Access Tokens**
3. Click **Create token**
4. Give it a name (e.g., "Tempo MCP Server")
5. Set appropriate permissions (read/write access to issues and worklogs)
6. Copy the token value for use in `TEMPO_PAT`

## Usage with AI Assistants

### GitHub Copilot Configuration (VS Code)

Add to your MCP servers configuration file (e.g., `mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "tempo-filler": {
      "type": "stdio", 
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "D:\\path\\to\\TempoFiller\\dist\\index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "TEMPO_BASE_URL": "https://jira.company.com",
        "TEMPO_PAT": "your-personal-access-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Add to your Claude Desktop config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tempo-filler": {
      "command": "node", 
      "args": ["path/to/TempoFiller/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "TEMPO_BASE_URL": "https://jira.company.com",
        "TEMPO_PAT": "your-personal-access-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Setup Steps

1. **Build the server**: `npm run build`
2. **Add configuration** to your AI assistant
3. **Restart** your AI assistant to load the MCP server
4. **Test the connection**: Ask "Get my worklogs for this week"

### Authentication Setup

The server uses Personal Access Tokens (PAT) for secure authentication:

1. **Generate a PAT** in your JIRA instance:
   - Go to **Profile** ‚Üí **Personal Access Tokens** 
   - Create token with **read/write permissions** for issues and worklogs
   - **Copy the token value** (you won't see it again)

2. **Set environment variables**:
   - `TEMPO_BASE_URL`: Your JIRA URL (e.g., `https://jira.company.com`)
   - `TEMPO_PAT`: Your personal access token

### Viewing Your Time Logs
```
"Get my July hours"
‚Üí Returns a summary of all worklogs for July with totals by issue and date

"Show me my worklogs for July 2025"  
‚Üí Uses get_worklogs to retrieve detailed worklog information

"What did I work on last week?"
‚Üí Fetches worklogs for the previous week with issue breakdown
```

### Creating Single Worklog Entries
```
"Log 8 hours to PROJ-1234 for July 10th"
‚Üí Creates a single worklog entry:
   ‚úÖ Issue: PROJ-1234 - Example Project Task
   ‚úÖ Hours: 8h (billable)
   ‚úÖ Date: 2025-07-10
   ‚úÖ Worklog ID: 1211549

"Post 6.5 hours on PROJ-123 for today with description 'Bug fixes and testing'"
‚Üí Uses post_worklog with custom description
```

### Bulk Worklog Creation
```
"Post 8 hours a day every weekday from July 11 to 15 on PROJ-1234"
‚Üí Creates 5 worklog entries (skips weekends):
   ‚úÖ July 11 (Friday): 8h
   ‚úÖ July 14 (Monday): 8h  
   ‚úÖ July 15 (Tuesday): 8h
   Total: 24 hours across 3 weekdays

"Fill my timesheet for this week - 4 hours PROJ-1111 and 4 hours PROJ-2222 each day"
‚Üí Uses bulk_post_worklogs with multiple issues per day

"Finish filling up the days until July 31st"
‚Üí Automatically fills remaining weekdays in the month
```

### Advanced Bulk Operations
```
"Log time for the entire month of July:
- PROJ-1234: 8 hours every weekday  
- Skip weekends
- All time should be billable"
‚Üí Creates 22 worklog entries for all weekdays in July

"Fill my Q2 timesheet with 8 hours daily split between:
- 60% on PROJ-1234 (development)
- 40% on PROJ-5678 (meetings)"
‚Üí Calculates hours and creates entries for the quarter
```

### Worklog Management
```
"Delete worklog with ID 1211547"
‚Üí Removes the specified worklog entry

"Show me a summary of my July hours by issue"
‚Üí Groups worklogs by issue with totals and percentages
```
